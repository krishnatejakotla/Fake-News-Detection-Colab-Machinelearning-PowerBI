## 🔬 Machine Learning Pipeline (Colab)

1. Import and clean data
2. Convert news text into vectors using **TF-IDF**
3. Train a **Logistic Regression** model to classify Fake vs Real news
4. Save the model and vectorizer using `joblib`
5. Predict on test data and export results as `.csv`

➡️ Open in Colab:
